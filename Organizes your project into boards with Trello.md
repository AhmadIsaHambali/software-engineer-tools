# **Organizes your project into boards with Trello**

[Trello](http://help.trello.com/article/708-what-is-trello) is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process.

[Board](http://help.trello.com/article/707-creating-a-new-board) is a collection of cards ordered in a list of lists. Its to manage a project, track a collection or organize anything. When we need to create a new board, also can clik Create new board.

For boards To Do, I'm gonna 
[create card](http://help.trello.com/article/729-adding-cards) 
'Membuat Resume' then 
[create a checklist](http://help.trello.com/article/737-adding-checklists-to-cards). 
Cards are the basic unit of a board. They might represent new software features, story leads, legal cases, things to buy at the store, freelance clients, potential employees, or customer support issues. Drag cards from list to list to indicate progression, status, or what-have-you. You can add people to cards, label them, vote, attach files, start conversations, create task checklists, and so on. And a checklist is a way of keeping track of subtasks within a card. 

 1. Dokumentasi teknis-dan non teknis
 2. Pengumpulan dilakukan menggunakan file format MD (MarkDown)
 3. Lengkapi gambar apabila diperlukan
 4. Format nama file markdown adalah [Judul-Resume.md]
 5. Identitas mahasiswa dimasukan ke dalam file MD, tidak perlu pada nama file
 6. Judul dibuat jelas dan menarik (dalam bahasa inggris lebih diutamakan).

Lalu dibuat siapa yg bertanggung jawab terhadap beberapa checklist dari card tadi, dengan melakukan drag dari member ke card yang harus dilakukan oleh member tersebut. When the checklist of the card are complete , it gonna be change into the green.

We can set the [Due Date](http://help.trello.com/article/794-adding-due-dates-to-cards) on the card.

A light grey badge means the card is due more than 24 hours in the future, yellow badge means it's within 24 hours of being due, a red badge means the card is due and it will remain red for 24 hours, a light pink badge means it's past due, and a green badge means it's complete. You can click the checkbox next to the due date to mark it as complete, and turn the due date green. This will also add a strike through on the card on the Calendar View. When we have to complete the cards, we can drag the cards into the list 'Done'
